# Resource: aws_finspace_kx_environment

Terraform resource for managing an AWS FinSpace Kx Environment.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { FinspaceKxEnvironment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/finspace-kx-environment";
import { KmsKey } from "./.gen/providers/aws/kms-key";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new KmsKey(this, "example", {
      deletionWindowInDays: 7,
      description: "Sample KMS Key",
    });
    const awsFinspaceKxEnvironmentExample = new FinspaceKxEnvironment(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        kmsKeyId: example.arn,
        name: "my-tf-kx-environment",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsFinspaceKxEnvironmentExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

### With Network Setup

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Ec2TransitGateway } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ec2-transit-gateway";
import { FinspaceKxEnvironment } from "./.gen/providers/aws/finspace-kx-environment";
import { KmsKey } from "./.gen/providers/aws/kms-key";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new Ec2TransitGateway(this, "example", {
      description: "example",
    });
    const awsKmsKeyExample = new KmsKey(this, "example_1", {
      deletionWindowInDays: 7,
      description: "Sample KMS Key",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    awsKmsKeyExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    new FinspaceKxEnvironment(this, "example_env", {
      customDnsConfiguration: [
        {
          customDnsServerIp: "10.0.0.76",
          customDnsServerName: "example.finspace.amazonaws.com",
        },
      ],
      description: "Environment description",
      kmsKeyId: Token.asString(awsKmsKeyExample.arn),
      name: "my-tf-kx-environment",
      transitGatewayConfiguration: {
        routableCidrSpace: "100.64.0.0/26",
        transitGatewayId: example.id,
      },
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the KX environment that you want to create.
* `kmsKeyId` - (Required) KMS key ID to encrypt your data in the FinSpace environment.

The following arguments are optional:

* `customDnsConfiguration` - (Optional) List of DNS server name and server IP. This is used to set up Route-53 outbound resolvers. Defined below.
* `description` - (Optional) Description for the KX environment.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `transitGatewayConfiguration` - (Optional) Transit gateway and network configuration that is used to connect the KX environment to an internal network. Defined below.

### custom_dns_configuration

The custom_dns_configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `customDnsServerIp` - (Required) IP address of the DNS server.
* `customDnsServerName` - (Required) Name of the DNS server.

### transit_gateway_configuration

The transit_gateway_configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `routableCidrSpace` - (Required) Routing CIDR on behalf of KX environment. It could be any “/26 range in the 100.64.0.0 CIDR space. After providing, it will be added to the customer’s transit gateway routing table so that the traffics could be routed to KX network.
* `transitGatewayId` - (Required) Identifier of the transit gateway created by the customer to connect outbound traffics from KX network to your internal network.

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) identifier of the KX environment.
* `availabilityZones` - AWS Availability Zone IDs that this environment is available in. Important when selecting VPC subnets to use in cluster creation.
* `createdTimestamp` - Timestamp at which the environment is created in FinSpace. Value determined as epoch time in seconds. For example, the value for Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000.
* `id` - Unique identifier for the KX environment.
* `infrastructureAccountId` - Unique identifier for the AWS environment infrastructure account.
* `lastModifiedTimestamp` - Last timestamp at which the environment was updated in FinSpace. Value determined as epoch time in seconds. For example, the value for Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000.
* `status` - Status of environment creation
* `tagsAll` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`defaultTags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `30M`)
* `update` - (Default `30M`)
* `delete` - (Default `30M`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import an AWS FinSpace Kx Environment using the `id`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import an AWS FinSpace Kx Environment using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_finspace_kx_environment.example n3ceo7wqxoxcti5tujqwzs
```
